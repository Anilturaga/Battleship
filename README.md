# Welcome to Battleship Game

[Play the game here](https://battleship-game.now.sh).

We made this whole game only using open source tools including assets and to continue the tradition we are making the code and all related assets `open source`.

Feel free to use any and all of this repository.

**Battleship-game** is pretty much recreation of the iconic(not really) battle scene where they use tsunami buoys to track aliens(bad guys?) and kill them using nothing but their wits and VL-ASROC missiles (Yes, I looked it up) .

## Files

Repo structure

We used [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/) as our renderer.

setup function creates sprites for map,ship,shipTitle,Battleship,Beacons. Uses the minimap to construct the whole map background(Not my best algorithm, suggest something)

gameLoop is our ticker function.

Creates basic animations such as active status of beacons

All assets are made using open source 2D tilesets
